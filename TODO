General stuff:
- pin down method and format for keeping track of files and tags
- implement a set of functions for operating on this:
    - list tags
    - list files under tag
    - list tags for a specific file
    - add a tag to a file (or put a file under a tag rather)
    - remove tag from file
    - find the tagging file from PWD
- write a cli frontend for harnessing these functions
